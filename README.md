# Data-Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in Go. Each data structure is organized into separate directories for easy navigation and access.

## 1. BST (Binary Search Tree)

The `BST` directory contains the implementation of a Binary Search Tree data structure. A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values in its left subtree and less than or equal to the values in its right subtree.

## 2. Binary Tree

The `Binary Tree` directory includes the implementation of a basic binary tree data structure. A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children: left child and right child.

## 3. Hashing

The `Hashing` directory contains implementations of hash table data structures. Hashing is a technique used to map data to a fixed-size array, allowing efficient data retrieval and storage.

## 4. Heap

The `Heap` directory includes the implementation of heap data structures. A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where the key of each node is either greater than or equal to (max heap) or less than or equal to (min heap) the keys of its children.

## 5. Matrix

The `Matrix` directory contains implementations of matrix data structures and basic matrix operations. A matrix is a two-dimensional array of elements often used for mathematical computations.

## 6. Queue

The `Queue` directory includes implementations of queue data structures. A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.

## 7. Singly Linked List

The `Singly Linked List` directory contains the implementation of a singly linked list data structure. A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next element, forming a chain-like structure.

## 8. Stack

The `Stack` directory includes implementations of stack data structures. A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.
